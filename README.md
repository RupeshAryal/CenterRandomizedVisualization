# CenterRandomizedVisualizaton
Visualizations of Grade 12 random center assignment by moest Nepal using streamlit. Displays the location of school and centers in openstreemap and also provides table for associated data and statistics.



### Here's my approach:
- Uses Folium to plot centers and schools on OpenStreetMap tile.
-  Created a new TSV file that contains latitude-longitude data for all the schools (center and non-center).
- Used pandas to handle all the queries of the available data.
- Created visualization including maps and tables with Streamlit.
- Hosted the app on Streamlit Community Cloud.
